# CVE Analysis

This document outlines the process of analyzing Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) to determine their significance, the criteria used for this analysis, and examples of how the analysis is performed.

## Analysis Process

The analysis process involves the following steps:

1. **Fetching CVE Data**: Retrieve the latest CVE data from the NVD API.
2. **Loading Raw Data**: Load the raw CVE data for analysis.
3. **Determining Significance**: Analyze the CVE data to identify significant vulnerabilities based on predefined criteria.
4. **Saving Analyzed Data**: Save the analyzed data for further use and notifications.

## Criteria for Determining Significance

To determine the significance of a CVE, the following criteria are used:

1. **CVSS Score**:
   - A CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) score is a numerical representation of the severity of a CVE.
   - CVEs with a CVSS score of 7.0 or higher are considered significant.

2. **Impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**:
   - The impact metrics of a CVE on confidentiality, integrity, and availability are analyzed.
   - CVEs with high impact on any of these metrics are considered significant.

3. **Exploitability**:
   - The exploitability score indicates how easily a vulnerability can be exploited.
   - CVEs with high exploitability scores are considered significant.

## Analyzing CVE Data

### Step 1: Fetching CVE Data

CVE data is fetched from the NVD API using the `fetch_cve.py` script. This script retrieves the latest CVEs and saves them as raw data in JSON format.

### Step 2: Loading Raw Data

The raw CVE data is loaded from the JSON files saved in the `backend/data/raw` directory. This is done using the `load_raw_data()` function in the `analyze_cve.py` script.

### Step 3: Determining Significance

The raw CVE data is analyzed to determine the significance of each CVE. This is done using the `analyze_cve_data()` function in the `analyze_cve.py` script. The function performs the following steps:

1. **Iterate through each CVE**: Loop through each CVE entry in the raw data.
2. **Extract CVSS Score**: Extract the CVSS score for each CVE.
3. **Check Impact Metrics**: Check the impact metrics on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
4. **Check Exploitability**: Check the exploitability score.
5. **Determine Significance**: If the CVSS score is 7.0 or higher, or if any impact metrics or exploitability scores are high, mark the CVE as significant.

### Step 4: Saving Analyzed Data

The significant CVEs are saved in a JSON file in the `backend/data/processed` directory. This is done using the `save_analyzed_data()` function in the `analyze_cve.py` script.

## Analysis Results

Here are some examples of significant CVEs identified through the analysis process:


```json
{
  "id": "CVE-2023-12345",
  "cvss_score": 9.8,
  "impact": {
    "confidentiality": "HIGH",
    "integrity": "HIGH",
    "availability": "HIGH"
  },
  "exploitability_score": 8.0,
  "description": "This is a critical vulnerability in software X that allows remote code execution."
}
```


## Conclusion

The analysis process is designed to identify significant CVEs based on their CVSS scores, impact metrics, and exploitability. By focusing on these criteria, the system can prioritize the most critical vulnerabilities, helping users to mitigate risks effectively.
